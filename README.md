# Online-Auction-System
This project implements an online auction system using Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system allows users to participate in auctions by placing bids in real-time. The server-side code handles bid processing, auction management, and timer functionalities, while the client-side code provides a user interface for interacting with the system. The auction system includes features such as setting auction IDs, submitting bids, starting auctions, displaying current highest bids and bidders, and triggering animations with congratulations message for the highest bidder at the end of an auction. The implementation ensures synchronization among clients through Socket.IO for real-time updates and communication. The HTML interface is styled using CSS to create an attractive and user-friendly experience. The system enhances engagement and interactivity in online auctions while providing a visually appealing interface for users.
